#### Hi there! I'm Saif  

 

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer specialzing in backend development, mostly in nodejs runtime, though I can work with any framework with decent frontend skills. I'm also interested in computer security, where I'm more inclined to research in malware analysis and exploit development. I regularly try to participate in online capture-the-flag events where my focus is mostly on reverse engineering and binary exploitation.

I'm an undergraduate currently studying at Islamic University Of Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh.
