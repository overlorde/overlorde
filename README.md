#### Hi there! I'm Saif  

##### look at my [resume](https://github.com/overlorde/overlorde/blob/main/farhansaif.pdf)
  
I'm an aspiring Software Engineer specialzing in backend development, mostly in nodejs runtime, though I can learn any framework with decent frontend skills. I'm also interested in computer security where I'm more inclined to research in malware analysis. I regularly try to participate in online capture-the-flag events where my focus is mostly on reverse engineering and binary exploitation.

I'm an undergraduate currently studying at Islamic University Of Technology, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

 I use arch for my daily chores , and vm to do my research stuff. I'm writing some malware analysis reports which I'll soon publish on github.
